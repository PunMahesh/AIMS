                    The Challenge of Sustainable Agriculture The world needs to produce at least 50% more food by 2050 to feed a projected 9 billion people. To help meet this goal, the Bank is working with countries to boost the productivity of farms, livestock and fisheries. This challenge must be met against a backdrop of food price volatility and over-stretched resources, when there is less water and uncultivated land for farming and livestock, and wild capture fishery stocks are decreasing. Agriculture is also more vulnerable to climate change than any other sector: Droughts, floods and warmer temperatures reduce crop yields, and it is estimated that for every 1Â°C of global warming, grain yields will decline by 5 percent.

                    To raise yields sustainably, the Bank supports Climate-Smart approaches that have potential to increase productivity, enhance resilience, and lower our footprint; promotes agricultural innovation through research and education; and facilitates responsible agricultural investment. More Crops, Livestock and Seafood The Bank promotes innovative approaches that can help smallholders get the most out of their farms and fisheries. Gender-specific interventions are key in this area, since women account for the majority of small holder farmersâ€”up to 70% in Africa alone. The Bank is committed to agricultural innovations that boost productivity, as well as better land and water managementâ€”US$ 1 billion was spent on irrigation and drainage in FY 2010â€“12. Watershed-management improved crop yields by up to 20 percent for Karnatakaâ€™s beneficiary farmers and higher-yielding seed varieties were piloted on selected farms in Uganda.

                    The Bank also promotes the use of new breeds, animal nutrition, veterinary services, vaccinations and improved husbandry, rangeland and pasture management to sustainably increase livestock productivity for about 1 billion people who depend on livestock for their livelihoods. The Bankâ€™s work on breeding and animal nutrition in India has improved the productivity of milk-giving animals. Adopting different breeds helped Assamâ€™s farmers grow their milk yields by 65 percent while better grassland management doubled the incomes of herders in Chinaâ€™s Gansu and Xinjiang regions. The Bank also supports sustainable aquaculture at coastal fisheries in Tanzania and Vietnam.
